* Primitive dataTypes: Basic/Fundamental data type used to declare a value
* Primitive data types has two category: 1.) Scalar type 2.) Compound type
* Scalar: A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary
* scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
* Compound: compound types can group multiple values into one type.
* Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
