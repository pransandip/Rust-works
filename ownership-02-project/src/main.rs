// ------------ Ownership rules -------------
// 1. Each value in rust has a variable that's called its owner, means one variable one owner.
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time, means variable can't have two owner at the same time.
// 3. When owner goes out of scope, the value will be droped.
// 4. Rust has a copy trait a simple type stored on the stack such as (int boolean and char) this traits allows those types to be copied instade of move
